Try to stay with quicklisp loadable, but for those packages that aren't:

Some older ones aren't even asdf loadable, until I got to them.

I will probably start with: https://github.com/MBcode/LispUtils/tree/master/stat

 but there are many more, some of them in links of: http://bit.ly/TP8gfz 

https://github.com/MBcode/LispUtils/tree/master/stat/ml-progs needed new change to ml.asd

Also plan to try: http://cl-www.msi.co.jp/solutions/knowledge/lisp-world/products/CLML-en.html

Also want some qr/constraints/&stats

As mentioned: https://github.com/MBcode/LispUtils/tree/master/stat/sapa
